# 🧭 Editorial Agent — Product Brief

## 🔧 What Is It?
The Editorial Agent is a local-first, LLM-powered automation that takes in documents (PDFs or Word files), analyzes them in structured chunks, and delivers rich, human-quality editorial feedback. Think of it as an autonomous editor that runs from your desktop.

## 🎯 Who Is It For?

| Audience              | Why It Helps                                                  |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Teachers & Educators | Quickly review worksheets, lesson plans, and study guides     |
| Authors              | Spot tone, grammar, and structure issues early                |
| Curriculum Designers | Polish entire book drafts for clarity and student comprehension |
| Editors & Publishers | Automate bulk reviews of manuscripts before human QA          |

## 📌 Problem It Solves

- Reviewing long documents manually is time-consuming
- Editors often focus on grammar but miss structure or tone
- AI tools are too generic or not tuned to document feedback
- Manual uploading to chatbots breaks workflow continuity

## 💡 How It Works

Just drop any `.pdf` or `.docx` into a folder. The agent:

1. Breaks it into manageable chunks (5–20 pages each)
2. Sends each chunk to GPT-4o with an expert editorial prompt
3. Generates a clean `.docx` report with scores, notes, and actionable suggestions
4. Logs all activity and verdicts into a CSV for tracking

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Hands-Free Editing** — Files auto-processed from a watch folder
- **Smart Chunking** — Dynamically sized based on document length
- **Scored Reports** — Grammar, structure, and clarity scored and reviewed
- **Page-Level Referencing** — Helps tie feedback back to source easily
- **Cost-Aware Design** — Uses GPT-4o for affordable, high-quality edits

## 🧠 What Makes It Unique?

- Combines local file automation + GPT prompting + structured chunking
- Feels like an editor who reads deeply and offers smart revisions
- Can be reused as a pattern to build any doc-driven LLM agent

## 🔮 Future Possibilities

- Turn feedback into tracked changes or inline comments
- Add report styling (PDF exports, summary visuals)
- Plug into Notion/Google Docs/Obsidian for cloud workflows
- Add feedback classifiers, plagiarism flags, or style guidance modes

## 🤝 Collaboration Ready

This can be integrated with a review team:

- Add roles (reviewer, editor, supervisor)
- Support for highlight types or comment categories
- Push reports to shared folders or collaborative platforms

## 🧭 Strategic Value

The Editorial Agent isn’t just a tool. It’s a testbed for:

- Chunking strategy + agent orchestration
- Prompt architecture reuse
- Running LLMs on longform content reliably
